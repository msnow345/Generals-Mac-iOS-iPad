# Command & Conquer Generals: Zero Hour — macOS, iOS & iPadOS

<img width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_3457_500" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aeaf6692-36e6-40c8-b9f8-8066d014ec4b" />

**Zero Hour running natively on Apple Silicon Macs, iPhone, and iPad** — campaign,
skirmish, and Generals Challenge, with [touch controls built for RTS](#touch-controls):
the map moves 1:1 under your fingers and coasts when you flick it, buildings are
carried into place and rotated with a second finger, plus tap-select, drag-box,
long-press deselect and pinch zoom. No emulation: this
is the real 2003 engine compiled for ARM64, rendering DirectX 8 →
[DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) → Vulkan →
[MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK) → Metal.

Built on EA's GPL v3 source release, standing on a chain of community work —
[TheSuperHackers](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode),
[Fighter19's original Unix port](https://github.com/Fighter19/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour), and
[fbraz3/GeneralsX](https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsX) — this fork adds the iOS/iPadOS
port and a set of engine fixes. See [Lineage & credits](#lineage--credits) for who built
what. The original GeneralsX README lives on the `upstream-main` branch.

**No game assets are included or distributed.** You need your own copy
([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732960/), ~$5 on sale).

## Touch controls

An RTS designed for a mouse gives you a pointer that hovers, two buttons, and a scroll
wheel. A touchscreen gives you none of those. Rather than paint a virtual mouse on the
screen, the touch layer here is built around **direct manipulation** — you move the map,
you carry the building, and the engine is told about it in the only language it speaks.

Every mouse event the game receives on iOS is synthesised from touch in
[`SDL3GameEngine.cpp`](GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngineDevice/Source/SDL3GameEngine.cpp); SDL's
own touch→mouse synthesis is switched off, so the gestures below are the *entire* input
vocabulary the 2003 engine ever sees.

### Gesture reference

| Gesture | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Tap | Select, or issue a command |
| Drag one finger | Selection box |
| Long press (600 ms) | Right click — deselect |
| Drag two fingers | Pan the map, 1:1 with your fingers |
| Flick two fingers | Pan with inertia |
| Pinch | Zoom |
| Touch while the map is coasting | Catches it, stops dead |

While a building is selected for construction:

| Gesture | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Drag one finger | Carry the structure under your finger |
| Carry toward a screen edge | Map scrolls; the structure stays under your finger |
| Tap a second finger | Rotation **on** — now aim with the carrying finger |
| Tap that second finger again | Rotation **off** — back to carrying |
| Hold that second finger (1.2 s) | Cancel the build |
| Lift | Place it |

### The map moves with your fingers

Two-finger drag is true 1:1 direct manipulation: the patch of ground under your fingers
stays under your fingers. Each frame the cursor's previous and current positions are
projected onto the terrain and the view shifts by the world-space difference, so it is
automatically correct at any zoom level and under Zero Hour's tilted camera — where a pixel
of vertical drag covers considerably more ground than a horizontal one.

This replaced the engine's stock right-mouse-drag scrolling, which is a *joystick*: it
scrolls every frame at a speed proportional to how far the cursor sits from where the
button went down. With a mouse that is fine. Under a finger it reads as the camera
accelerating away from you and never quite stopping where you meant.

### Inertia

A flick coasts and decays, and a touch catches it — the two behaviours that make a scroll
surface feel alive on iOS.

The decay is applied **per millisecond**, not per frame, at `0.998` — UIScrollView's normal
deceleration rate, giving roughly a 1.5-second glide. A per-frame decay would send the same
flick further on a faster device. Frame deltas are clamped to 50 ms so a hitch cannot
teleport the map, and if the camera stops moving because it is pinned against a map
boundary the glide is dropped rather than ground out against the edge.

### Placing buildings

The awkward part of building placement on a touchscreen is that the engine's model — press
to anchor, drag to set the facing, release to commit — assumes a pointer that was already
hovering over the battlefield before you pressed anything. Touch has no hover.

So placement is re-mapped rather than re-implemented, which means the engine's own
placement arrow, wall-run preview and validation all still work unchanged:

- **Carrying** sends cursor movement with no button held, so the engine leaves the
  placement un-anchored and simply draws the ghost wherever the cursor is.
- **Tapping the second finger** presses the left button, which *is* what puts the engine
  into angle mode. The placement arrow appearing is your feedback that rotation is live.
  Tapping again un-anchors and hands the structure back to your finger.
- **Holding the second finger** cancels. It never presses anything, so there is no held
  button to unwind and no stray click to leak into the world.

Three details that only matter once you actually use it:

- **The ghost appears in the middle of the view**, not at your last tap. With a mouse the
  pointer is already out over the map when you click a build button; on touch the cursor is
  sitting on the command bar you just pressed, so a new ghost used to appear down in the
  corner.
- **Rotation ignores the first ~10 mm.** When rotation switches on, your finger is sitting
  exactly on the anchor, and the facing is derived from anchor→cursor — so without a dead
  circle the building spins wildly on sub-millimetre movement.
- **The edge-scroll band is sized for a fingertip** (a twentieth of the screen height)
  rather than the engine's 3 pixels, which is about a millimetre on a modern display and
  also collides with iOS's own edge-swipe gestures. It is active only while placing, since
  the rest of the time two-finger pan already covers moving the map.

### Haptics

A light tap when rotation engages, a medium one when a structure is placed, a heavier one
when a build is cancelled. Timed gestures in particular have no physical affordance —
nothing depresses — so a haptic is the only way to tell a deliberate mode change from a
misfire.

iPhone only in effect, but not in code: `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` is simply inert on
hardware without a Taptic Engine, which includes every iPad, so no device check is needed.

### Known rough edges

- **Haptics are unverified.** They were developed on an iPad, which has no Taptic Engine,
  so they have never actually fired. They link and the call sites are right; that is all
  that is currently known.
- **Rotating walls is untested.** Line-build templates (walls, gates) treat anchor→cursor
  as a *run* rather than an angle, so rotation mode on a wall will sweep its endpoint
  around a circle rather than extend it. That may be wrong for walls specifically.
- **A resting finger does not stop a coasting map** — only a tap or a new pan does. The
  touch layer sends no button until a gesture commits, so there is nothing to signal a
  finger merely being parked.

## What this port actually involved

"Porting" undersells how weird this journey was, so here's the honest shape of it.
The lineage below built the foundation: EA's source release, the community's
modernization, Fighter19's original Unix port, GeneralsX's macOS/Linux work.
What did *not* exist was any of this on iOS — and iOS is a hostile place for a
2003 Windows RTS:

- **The engine assumes a writable filesystem wherever it lives.** iOS apps live in a
  read-only, code-signed bundle. Every config write, cache, and save path had to be
  rerouted — and the working directory bootstrapped from the bundle itself.
- **The renderer speaks DirectX 8. The iPad speaks Metal.** In between: DXVK
  translating D3D8→Vulkan, MoltenVK translating Vulkan→Metal — and DXVK had never
  been built for iPhoneOS. That took a Meson cross-build and a patch to its Vulkan
  loader, because iOS confines `dlopen` to the app bundle ([`Patches/dxvk-ios.patch`](Patches/dxvk-ios.patch)).
- **iOS owns your process.** Open the app switcher and the OS seizes the Metal
  drawable *without backgrounding you* — draw one more frame and you're dead on
  resume. The whole render/sim loop learned to hold its breath.
- **An RTS needs a mouse.** SDL3 (from the lineage below) delivers raw touch events;
  the RTS semantics on top are new. Taps defer until the 2003 GUI has processed
  hover (or menu buttons never highlight), a drag has to decide "selection box or
  camera pan," long-press became right-click, and a cancelled touch must never
  ghost-click a rally point.
- **And then the bug hunts** — the best part. The minimap that rendered black
  because a 2003 texture-format fallback silently dropped the alpha channel. The
  EVA voice that went randomly mute because one zombie audio stream held a global
  "don't talk over speech" flag while chirping forever. Every one chased to root
  cause on a real device, fixed, and offered upstream.

**→ How to do this to another game: [docs/port/PORTING_PATTERNS.md](docs/port/PORTING_PATTERNS.md)**

Worth saying plainly: this was a **human + AI collaboration**. The engineering —
the C++, the cross-builds, the device debugging — was done by
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (Anthropic's Claude, Fable model),
directed and playtested by a human who described symptoms like *"the minimap is
black"* and *"I hear chirping"* and owned every decision. Neither half ships this
alone: one of us can't write C++, and the other can't hear the chirping.

## Quick start — macOS

Prerequisites (one time):

Download the MacOS Vulkan SDK from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home and install locally.

```sh
# Toolchain
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ninja meson pkgconf libpng ffmpeg
brew install --cask steamcmd

# vcpkg (full clone — a shallow clone breaks manifest baselines)
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg ~/vcpkg && ~/vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=~/vcpkg          # add to your shell profile

# LunarG Vulkan SDK (NOT the Homebrew cask) — https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home
export VULKAN_SDK=$HOME/VulkanSDK/<version>/macOS   # add to your shell profile
```

Clone, build, get assets, play:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ammaarreshi/Generals-Mac-iOS-iPad.git GeneralsX
cd GeneralsX
./scripts/build/macos/build-macos-zh.sh     # checks deps, configures, builds
./scripts/build/macos/deploy-macos-zh.sh    # creates ~/GeneralsX/GeneralsZH + run.sh
./scripts/get-assets.sh <your_steam_username>   # fetches game data you own. Note that this will prompt you for your Steam Guard code, etc.
cd ~/GeneralsX/GeneralsZH && ./run.sh -win
```

## Quick start — iPhone / iPad

On top of the macOS prerequisites: full Xcode (signed into your Apple ID),
`brew install xcodegen`, and a (free or paid) Apple Developer team.

```sh
cd GeneralsX
git submodule update --init references/fbraz3-dxvk   # iOS DXVK is built from this + Patches/dxvk-ios.patch
./scripts/build/ios/fetch-moltenvk.sh                # pinned MoltenVK.framework (checksummed)
./scripts/build/ios/stage-fonts.sh                   # Liberation fonts, renamed as the game expects
cmake --preset ios-vulkan
cmake --build build/ios-vulkan --target z_generals
GX_TEAM_ID=<your-team-id> GX_BUNDLE_ID=com.you.generalszh \
    ./scripts/build/ios/package-ios-zh.sh --install  # assembles, signs, installs
```

Assets ship inside the app bundle (self-contained install); `--dev` skips the ~2.7 GB copy for fast code
iteration.

Note that you will need to register your device in XCode before the deployment.

### Finding your Apple Developer Account Team ID

If you have a paid Apple Developer account, you can find your team id in Xcode → Settings → Accounts. 

Altnernatively if you have a free Apple Developer account:

- Open Xcode on your Mac.
- Go to Settings then Accounts.
- Sign in with your Apple ID.
- Click Manage Certificates and add a new certificate.
- Open the Mac app Keychain Access and go to the login keychain.
- Under My Certificates, double click your Apple Development certificate.
- Your Team ID is the string of letters and numbers next to Organizational Unit

### Fixing Missing Vulcan Headers Error

When running `cmake --build build/ios-vulkan --target z_generals` you may see an error referring to missing Vulcan headers. This requires the path to the header include files to be set explicity using the commands below.

```
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/include
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/include
```

### Fixing Missing d3d11_4.h file not found Error

When running `cmake --build build/ios-vulkan --target z_generals` you may see an error referring to a missing d3d11_4.h file. 

You can check if the files are missing by running `find references/fbraz3-dxvk -name d3d11_4.h`. If nothing is returned, then this requires fixing the DXVK submodule using the commands below

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Fixing Bundle Identifier Errors

You may get a Bundle Identifier error when attemtping to run the XCode project from within XCode.

> Failed Registering Bundle Identifier
> The app identifier "me.ammaar.generalszh" cannot be registered to your development team because it is not available. Change your bundle identifier to a unique string to try again.

This can be fixed by changing the Product Bundle Identifier under `Build Settings` -> `Signing & Capabilities` -> `Bundle Identifier` in XCode to the another value - e.g. `me.myname.generalszh`. Save the project but do not attempt to run and deploy the app from XCode at this stage.

### Fixing ERROR: The specified device was not found

You may see ann error when you attempt to install the app using the `./scripts/build/ios/package-ios-zh.sh --install` command.

```
ERROR: The specified device was not found.
(Name: 13-inch)
```

This can be fixed by manually installing the app using `xcrun devicectl device install app --device "YOUR DEVICE NAME" GeneralsX/build/ios-package/GeneralsXZH.app`, where you device name can be obtained by running `xcrun xctrace list devices` (exluding the iOS version number)

### Fixing this application cannot be launched errors

After a number of days, if you are using a free Apple Developer account, your certificate will expire and you will need to rebuilt and re-upload the application.

This can be done by executing the steps below which will re-package and sign the application, after which we will install it using `xcrun devicectl device install app --device "YOUR DEVICE NAME" GeneralsX/build/ios-package/GeneralsXZH.app`

```
GX_TEAM_ID=<your-team-id> GX_BUNDLE_ID=com.you.generalszh \
    ./scripts/build/ios/package-ios-zh.sh
xcrun devicectl device install app --device "YOUR DEVICE NAME" GeneralsX/build/ios-package/GeneralsXZH.app
```

## Known issues

- Long sessions on iPad can be killed by iOS for memory (~3 GB+ resident); the app
  exits to the home screen with no dialog. Session logs (current + previous) are in
  the Files app under the game's folder. Under investigation.
- Backgrounding mid-game can occasionally crash on iOS — the lifecycle pause covers
  the common paths; a rare race remains. Save often.

## What's next: Renegade 👀

Generals had a chain of giants to stand on. **Command & Conquer: Renegade** — EA's
2002 FPS from the same GPL source release — has far less: no native macOS or iOS
build of the W3D engine has ever shipped (Mac players today go through Wine-based
compatibility layers). The [OpenW3D](https://github.com/w3dhub/OpenW3D) community
project has real cross-platform groundwork — a DXVK wrapper scaffold and SDL3 build
plumbing — with Mac/Linux on its roadmap, and that groundwork is exactly what we
built on.

Same methodology as this repo, much deeper water: OpenW3D's Win32 compat scaffold
expanded by ~3,000 lines (the engine calls raw Windows APIs for file finding,
keyboard state, COM), a case-sensitivity strategy for twenty thousand asset paths,
the DXVK/MoltenVK renderer bring-up, the audio/video stack, and FPS touch controls.
It's playable today — campaign, cinematics, mission scripts — on a Mac and an
iPhone. For scale: this Generals port added ~2,200 lines on top of GeneralsX;
Renegade needed ~6,700 on top of the Windows-only source.

Repo drops soon, with the OpenW3D lineage credited the way this repo credits its
chain. Same rules: GPL v3, bring your own copy, full engineering log.
